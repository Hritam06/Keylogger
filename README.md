# Keylogger

## I have created a `Keylogger` using Python.

### This Keylogger will track the activities (keys pressed) on a keyboard and will save the activities (keys pressed) in a text file.

### Library used :- `pynput`

### To install the above library use the following command :-  `pip install pynput`
### Create a text file in the same directory as `Log.txt`
### Please do read the Pynput Documentation to know more about `pynput`
